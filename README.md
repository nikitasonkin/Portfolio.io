## About Me
I am driven by a passion for solving real-world challenges through code, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. My expertise spans:

- **Data Engineering & Analytics:** Python, SQL, pandas, NumPy, Spark  
- **Machine Learning & NLP:** scikit-learn, sentence-transformers, BART summaries  
- **Visualization & BI:** Power BI, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly  
- **Automation & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines  
- **Cybersecurity:** Secure architectures, automation for threat detection  

I believe that AI and data science are the foundation for the next wave of business innovation. My goal is to continue developing autonomous agents and intelligent systems that uncover insights, predict trends, and empower decision-making.

## Projects

### Cyber News Bot
**Repository:** [CyberNewsBot](https://github.com/nikitasonkin/CyberNewsBot)  
A modular data pipeline that:
- Ingests cybersecurity RSS feeds  
- Uses newspaper3k and BART for article extraction and summarization  
- Deduplicates via SHA-256 hashes  
- Delivers summaries reliably to Telegram and Microsoft Teams with retry logic  

### CyberBot Analyst Project
**Repository:** [CyberBot-Analyst-Project](https://github.com/nikitasonkin/CyberBot-Analyst-Project)  
An end-to-end analytics pipeline for CyberNewsBot data:
- SQL schema defining normalized tables (PostedNews, SkippedNews, Topics, Articles, Trends)  
- Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating JSON ingestion, feature engineering, embedding & clustering  
- Writes enriched topic and trend summaries back to SQL for downstream dashboards  

### CyberBot PowerBI
**Repository:** [CyberBotPowerBI](https://github.com/nikitasonkin/CyberBotPowerBI/tree/main)  
A Power BI dashboard built on the CyberBot Analyst Project:
- Interactive pages for Overview, Posted vs Skipped, Articles Explorer, Topics & Trends, Q&A  
- Trend detection, sentiment analysis, geographic breakdown, and forecasting  

### WWL Sales Analytics
**Repository:** [WWL-Sales-Analytics](https://github.com/nikitasonkin/WWL-Sales-Analytics)  
A toolkit of 10 advanced T-SQL queries against Microsoft’s Wide World Importers sample database:
- Yearly revenue and customer performance  
- Product profitability and churn analysis  
- Actionable insights via optimized SQL  

### AdventureWorks Sales Schema
**Repository:** [AdventureWorks-Sales-Schema](https://github.com/nikitasonkin/AdventureWorks-Sales-Schema-)  
A full relational database design and ETL demonstration:
- Schema definition for sales analytics  
- Data loading from AdventureWorks2022  
- Analytical queries showcasing database modeling  

### Happiness and Health Analysis
**Repository:** [Happiness-and-Health-Analysis](https://github.com/nikitasonkin/-Happiness-and-Health-Analysis)  
A global analytics pipeline examining well-being indicators:
- Data collection and cleaning with Python (pandas, NumPy)  
- Statistical methods (correlation, regression) on health and happiness factors  
- Interactive visualizations with Matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly
